# Philippines Script Keyboards

I created this repository to provide input method for Phillipines local scripts on Linux through the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/">m17n Library</a>. The .mim files meant to be included to the /usr/share/m17n folder. To activate the keyboard, you need to install the iBus. Please visit https://github.com/ibus/ibus for more details.  

The input method available at present are: 
* Baybayin - tl-baybayin.mim (version 1.0)
* Buhid - bku-buhid.mim (version 1.0)
* Tagbanwa - tbw-tagbanwa.mim (version 1.0)
* Hanunuo - hnn-hanunuo.mim (version 1.0)

The fonts for correct scripts rendering have been provided on the latest Linux distros. In case you could not find them on your system, please get them on the Google's Noto Fonts https://www.google.com/get/noto/.
