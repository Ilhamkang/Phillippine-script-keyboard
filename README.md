# Philippine-Script-Keyboards

I created this repository to provide input method for Southeast Asian scripts through .mim file for Linux through <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/">the m17n Library</a>. The files meant to be included to the /usr/share/m17n folder. 

The input method available at present are: 
* Baybayin
* Buhid
* Tagbanwa
* Hanunuo
