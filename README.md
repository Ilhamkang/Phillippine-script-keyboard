# Philippine-Script-Keyboards

I created this repository to provide input method for Southeast Asian scripts on Linux through the <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/m17n/">m17n Library</a>. The .mim files meant to be included to the /usr/share/m17n folder.

The input method available at present are: 
* Baybayin - tl-baybayin.mim
* Buhid - bku-buhin.mim
* Tagbanwa - tbw-tagbanwa.mim
* Hanunuo - hnn-hanunuo.mim

The fonts for rendering the scripts correctly has been provided on the latest Linux distros. In case you could not find them on your system, please get them on the Google's Noto Fonts https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-source.
